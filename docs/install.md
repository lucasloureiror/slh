# Installation

To install Service Level Helper, you need to have Go installed on your machine. If you don't have Go installed, you can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

Once you have Go installed, you can install Service Level Helper by running the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/lucasloureiror/slh@latest
```
This will install Service Level Helper in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory. Make sure that this directory is in your `$PATH` environment variable.

You can also download binaries directly through [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lucasloureiror/slh/releases) and put in your `$PATH` or anywhere you prefer.
